1.	Angular Google Maps (AGM)
2.	Google Maps
3.	Angular ESRI Maps

Found limitations on below listed out items:

1.	Location Marker: Cannot use merged font awesome images. We can use single font awesome images.
2.	Cluster Marker:
a.	Cannot use font awesome images.
b.	If we use multiple clusters, then there is a chance the images will overlap.
